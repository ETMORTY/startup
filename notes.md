## AWS Notes

DNS: Domain Name System
- A way to make things simpler (We don't have to type in the numbers of someone's location, but we can do it by a name)
- You look up a name of a website, and a DNS server tells you what the IP address of that server is

For windows: Use nslookup to find the IP of a website

**Domain Names**
[subdomain.]secondary.top(tld)
- A/AAAA - Address record
- CNAME - Another name to go by (lds.org vs churchofjesuschrist.org)

## HTML Notes

Usually starts with:
<!Doctype html>
<html lang="eng">
<head>
    <title>A Title</title> #displayed on the tab
</head>

<body>
...
</body>

In Chrome, you can use "about:blank" and use devtools to edit directly in a browser

Local IP is 127.0.0.1
