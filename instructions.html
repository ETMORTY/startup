        <h3>What is a story date?</h3>
            <p>A story date is an idea that originally came from my brother. It's foundation is a "choose your own adventure story." 
            If you know what those are, the rest will be pretty simple. If not, <a href="instructions.html#adventure">click here</a>. The idea behind this
            concept is that instead of already having the date planned before you head out, all you have is ideas for what you
            could do. As you read through the "choose your own adventure story," you will be creating your date along the way.
            <span>Perfect for group dates or smaller!</span></p>
        <h3>How do I set it up?</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Pick a story from the <a href="stories.html">stories</a> tab</li>
                <li>Decide on options for the date <span>(Feel free to customize and add alternatives in case of weather)</span></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 activities options</li>
                    <li>4 dinner options</li>
                    <li>8 dessert options</li>
                    <li>16 movie options</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Assign numbers and letters to each option</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>e.g. 1A-Activity #1, 1B-Activity #2, 2A-Dinner #1, etc.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Record these labels somewhere you can access</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>A fun idea <span>(if you have time)</span>, place each option into an envelope with the label for you to open
                         throughout the night</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
