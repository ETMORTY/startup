# Story Date

[My Notes](notes.md)

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

It is hard to come up with ideas for creative dates, so why not let a story create that for you. Story Date is a place where people can share their "choose your own adventure" stories with others. With these stories, people can select one and come up with a list of activities, dinners, desserts, and movies to attach to the different choices in the story. As you and your date (or your group), read through the story and make your choices, you are creating a unique date for you to do as well as enjoying the story contributions of others. _(Future additions to this will be a way to randomly select the options to attach to the story based on local information.)_

### Design

This sequence diagram shows how people will be able to add their own stories and how they will be able to see other people's stories.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Use HTML to strcture the webpage. Three HTML pages for login, instructions, and adding/accessing stories. There will be hyperlinks to jump between pages. 
- **CSS** - Styling the pages to make them look simple and easy to read. Choosing colors and fonts to organize and make the website look good. 
- **React** - Allows buttons for adding files to work and makes the login work. 
- **Service** - Using other services for:
    - Login
    - Submitting/Sharing Files
    - Collaborative writing
- **DB/Login** - Save and store login info in a secure database. Can't submit stories without being logged in. Register and Login users to access stories.
- **WebSocket** - All public stories can be accessed and read by other users.
