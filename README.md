> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

## 🚀 Specification Deliverable

> [!NOTE]
>  Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [ ] Proper use of Markdown
- [ ] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [ ] Description of key features
- [ ] Description of how you will use each technology
- [ ] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

It is hard to come up with ideas for creative dates, so why not let a story create that for you. Story Date is a place where people can share their "choose your own adventure" stories with others. With these stories, people can select one and come up with a list of activities, dinners, desserts, and movies to attach to the different choices in the story. As you and your date (or your group), read through the story and make your choices, you are creating a unique date for you to do as well as enjoying the story contributions of others. _(Future additions to this will be a way to randomly select the options to attach to the story based on local information.)_

### Design

![Design image](/Web%20Project%20Design.jpg)

This sequence diagram shows how people will be able to add their own stories and how they will be able to see other people's stories.
